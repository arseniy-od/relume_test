# Relume Component Developer Test

Please build the following components.

* Header 109 - https://www.relume.io/preview?cid=uncommon-components-2/section_header109
* Header 111 - https://www.relume.io/preview?cid=uncommon-components-2/section_header111

The react components should be fully responsive, and look and function like the demos provided.

You may place the code in the already created components folder.

We have pre-installed the Relume Tailwind config. You can read more about it in the docs https://react-docs.relume.io/getting-started/tailwind

Feel free to look around the existing Relume Library for examples of how many of our other components are built: https://www.relume.io/react/components

Build the components using React, Typescript, Tailwind, Framer Motion (if needed) and Relume UI. If you need to customize the Relume UI components, you can also just use Shadn UI components in their place (but you probably wont need to)
